## Apply ER-to-Relational Mapping Rules to Existing ER Diagram
This project presents the complete relational schema for a company's employee-project-department system. It is based on an ER diagram created in a previous task and follows standard ER-to-relational mapping rules.

The schema includes:
- Strong entities (e.g., Employee, Department, Project)
- A weak entity (Dependent) with appropriate foreign key constraints
- A multivalued attribute (Department_Locations) mapped into a separate table
- A many-to-many relationship (Works_On) with an attribute (WorkingHours)
- One-to-many and one-to-one relationships using foreign keys
- Clearly defined primary keys and foreign keys for all tables

The attached ER diagram image visualizes all entities and their relationships.
